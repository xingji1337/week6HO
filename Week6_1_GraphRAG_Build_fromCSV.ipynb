Workshop Reference / Working with Materials 553 Working with Materials Using Nails Every nail type is designed for a highly specialized purpose. The broad head on a roofing nail is ideal for fastening shingles but unsightly as a finish nail on moldings and trim. Nail lengths are identified by num\\u00ac bers from 4 to 60, followed by the letter \\u201cd,\\u201d which stands for \\u201cpenny.\\u201d Some specialty nails are identified by either length or gauge. Other specialty nails\\u2014like wallboard nails, siding nails, masonry nails, and flooring nails\\u2014are identified by their intended function. Angling nails as shown will provide better holding power than driving them in straight. Use the right hammer for the job. The tack hammer at rear Toenailing is one method of joining two pieces of wood when is magnetized to hold the tack, and is lightweight to avoid endnailing isn't possible, damaging wood. Common nail types include (left to right): wallboard nail (1), galvanized roofing nail (2), rubber-gasket nail (3), concrete nail (4), hardwood flooring nail (5), common framing nail (6), finishing nail (7), and double\\u00ac headed nail (8). To avoid splitting wood, stagger nails so they don't all enter the same spot in the wood grain. 554 Workshop Reference / Working with Materials Use the proper nailing technique for the task. Endnailing is used to attach perpendicular boards when moderate strength is required. Toenail at a 45\\u00b0 angle for extra strength when joining perpendicular framing members. Facenail to create strong headers for door and win\\u00ac dow openings. Blindnail tongue-and-groove boards to conceal nails, eliminating the need to set nails and cover them with putty before painting or staining. Locknail outside miter joints in trim projects to prevent gaps from developing as the trim pieces dry. Pulling Nails with a Hammer Remove stubborn nails by placing a block of wood under the hammer head for added leverage. Use a block big enough to evenly distribute pressure from the hammer head. Pull large nails by wedging the shank of the nail tightly in the claws and levering the hammer handle sideways. Turn your claw hammer into a mini nail-puller for small fin\\u00ac ish nails and brads by filing a '/\\u00ab\\\" notch into one claw, using a triangular needle file (inset). Workshop Reference / Working with Materials 555 Working with Materials Using Screws Screws are categorized according to length, slot style, head shape, and gauge. The thickness of the screw is indicated by the gauge number; the larger the gauge number, the larger the screw. Large screws provide extra holding power; small screws are less likely to split a workpiece. Counterbore a pilot bole and countersink tbe screw bead using this combination drill bit. Lubricating a screw with beeswax makes for easier driving with a screwdriver or screwqun. Choose a screwdriver that fits the slot in the screw head. The narrow blade of the driver at right may slip and damage the screw head or workpiece. To drill an effective pilot hole, select a drill bit slightly smaller than the screw shank diameter. Screw types include: flat- and oval-head wood screws (1, 2), machine screw with nut (3), screw with washer for securing fiberglass panels (4), machine screw (5), sheet-metal screw (6), wallboard screw (7), and lag screw (8). 556 Workshop Reference / Working with Materials Using Bolts, Washers & Nuts according to threads per inch; smaller bolts have more threads per inch. Washers are used under bolt-heads and nuts to help distribute pres\\u00ac sure and prevent damage to surfaces. Specialty washers, such as locking or toothed washers, help prevent nuts from becoming loose. Bolts and nuts bind together workpieces, providing strong connections that are easy to separate without causing damage to the materials. Much like screws, bolts are classified not only by type, but also accord\\u00ac ing to gauge (or thickness) and length. In some cases, bolts also are labeled Tighten bolts and nuts using two wrenches, turning each in opposite directions, in areas with limited access, use a proper-size socket with a ratchet. To ensure secure connections, the end of the bolt should pro\\u00ac ject through the nut by at least two threads. when the hole is larger than the bolt being used, cover it using a fender washer\\u2014a large flat washer with a small hole.\",\n          \"the tear-off, or see a portion of damaged sheathing, it\\u2019s time to replace it.

Then, position the dumpster directly below the roof edge, so the debris can be dumped from the roof. If it's not practical to rent a dumpster, using wheelbarrows set on tarps is an alternative. However, in the end, you'll be responsible for disposing of the debris, which will probably require several trips to the landfill. damaged area. Pry out the damaged sections (photo F).

Exterior Repairs / Roofing 199 Roofing Installing a New Roof Installing Building Paper Building paper is installed on the roof decks as insurance in case leaks develop in shingles or flashing. It is sold in several weights, but 30# paper is a good choice for use under shingles. In colder climates, Building Codes often require an underlayment called \\u201cice guard\\u201d or \\u201cice shield,\\u201d instead of standard building paper, for the first one or two courses of underlay\\u00ac ment. An adhesive membrane, the ice guard bonds with the sheathing to create a barrier to water backing up from ice dams. Snap a chalk line 35W up from the edge of the eaves, so the first course of the 36\\\"-wide membrane will overhang the eaves by W. Install a course of ice guard, using the chalk line as a reference and peeling back the protec\\u00ac tive backing as you unroll the ice guard (photo A). In cold climates, apply as many courses of ice guard as it takes to cover 24\\\" past the roof overhang. In warmer climates, ice guard may not be necessary, so check your local Codes. Measure up from the eaves\\u2019 edge to a point 32\\\" above the top of the previous course of underlayment, and snap another chalk line. Roll out the next course of building paper (ice guard, if required), always overlapping the first course by 4\\\". Attach building paper with a hammer stapler, driving a staple every 6\\\" to 12\\\" at the edges and one staple per square foot in the field area (photo B).

Tools: Chalk line, flat pry bar, hammer stapler, roofing knife, tape measure, aviation snips. Materials: 30# building paper and/or ice-guard underlayment, drip edge, roofing cement, roofing nails. Overlap building paper to ensure complete coverage of the roof deck. Fit building paper patches over obstructions such as vent pipes and roof vents (photo D). Apply building paper up to the obstruction. Then resume laying the course on the oppo\\u00ac site side (making sure to maintain the line). Cut a patch that overlaps the building paper by 12\\\" on all sides. Make a cross-hatch cutout for the obstruction. Position the patch, staple it in place, then caulk the seams with roofing cement. At the bottom of dormers and sidewalls, tuck the building paper under the siding (photo E), where it intersects with the roof. Also tuck it under counterflashing on chim\\u00ac neys and skylights. Carefully pry up the siding and tuck at least 2\\\" of paper under the siding. Leave the siding or counterflashing unfas\\u00ac tened until after you install the step flashing.

At first, patches may be obvious, but they will quickly blend in as they discolor. Wear heavy gloves, and beware of sharp edges when handling flashing. Patching Valley Flashing When repairing valley flashing, the damaged flashing is not removed, but is instead patched over with pieces of new material. Measure the damaged area and mark an outline for the patch. The patch should be wide enough to slip under the shingles on both sides of the repair area, and tapered to a point at one end. Cut the patch with aviation snips (photo A). Cut the metal patch to size, using aviation snips. Make sure the patch is wide enough to fit under the shingles. Using a trowel or flat pry bar, carefully break the seal between the damaged flashing and the surrounding shingles. Scrub the damaged flashing with a wire brush, and wipe it clean. Apply a heavy bead of roofing cement to the back of the patch (photo B). Cut a slit in the old flashing. Insert the tapered end of the patch into the slit in the Apply a continuous bead of roofing cement along the edges of the patch.

Rest the square end of the patch on top of the old flashing, and press it firmly to seal the roofing cement joint. Add roofing cement to the exposed seams and at the shingle joints. Using a trowel, feather out the cement to create a smooth path for water flow (photo C). Be sure all of the seams are covered. Smooth out the roofing cement to ensure that water flows smoothly and doesn't dam up. 194 Ext erior Repairs / Roofing Installing Vent Flashing Install shingles up to the vent pipe so that the flashing rests on at least one shingle. Apply a heavy double bead of roofing cement along the bottom edges of the flange. Position the flashing collar so the longer portion of the tapered neck slopes down the roof and the flange lies over the shingles. Nail around the perimeter of the flange with roofing nails (photo D). Cut the shingles to fit around the neck of the flashing so they lie flat against the flange (photo E). Apply roofing cement to the shingle and flashing joints, and cover any exposed nails. Spread a heavy bead of roofing cement on the bottom of the flashing, then lower it over the vent pipe and nail it in place. Replacing Step Flashing To replace a piece of step flashing, carefully bend up the counterflashing or siding covering the damaged flashing. Cut any roofing cement seals, and pull back the shingles. Use a flat bar to remove the damaged flashing (photo F). Cut the new flashing to fit, and apply roofing cement to all unexposed edges. Slip the flashing into place, making sure it\\u2019s overlapped by the flashing above it and that it overlaps the flashing and the shingle below it (photo G). Remove the damaged flashing, using a flat pry bar. Apply roofing cement, and install the new flashing. Cat shingles to fit and install them over and around the flashing.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
